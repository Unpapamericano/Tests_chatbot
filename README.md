Features
PDF Document Loading
The project provides functionality to load PDF files from a folder, read the content of each page, and split them into individual documents. This is useful for processing multi-page PDF files and handling large amounts of text data.

Functionality:
load_documents_from_folder(folder_path): Loads PDF files from a specified folder.
load_documents(pdf_path): Extracts text from individual PDF files and returns a list of documents.
Text Splitting
Once the text is extracted from PDF files, it can be split into smaller chunks for easier processing using the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter from the langchain_text_splitters package.

Functionality:
split_documents(documents): Splits text into smaller chunks with a specified chunk size and overlap for text chunking.
Embeddings Integration
This project integrates text embeddings using the OllamaEmbeddings from langchain_community. These embeddings are useful for a variety of NLP tasks, including text similarity, clustering, and classification.

Functionality:
get_embedding_function(): Returns an embedding function that can be used to obtain vector representations of the text.
The socket server setup allows for interactions with the embeddings module via a network interface.
Usage
Loading PDFs from Folder
To load all PDF files from a folder and process them:

python

folder_path = "path_to_your_pdf_folder"
all_documents = load_documents_from_folder(folder_path)

if all_documents:
    print(f"Number of documents loaded: {len(all_documents)}")
    print("First document content:")
    print(all_documents[0])
else:
    print("No documents loaded.")
Text Splitting Example
To split loaded documents into smaller chunks:

python

pdf_path = "path_to_your_pdf_file.pdf"
documents = load_documents(pdf_path)
chunks = split_documents(documents)

print("First chunk of the document:")
print(chunks[0])
Embedding Example
To generate text embeddings using the Ollama model:

python

from langchain_community.embeddings.ollama import OllamaEmbeddings

def get_embedding_function():
    embeddings = OllamaEmbeddings(model="nomic-embed-text")
    return embeddings

# Example usage
embedding_function = get_embedding_function()
Network Server for Embedding Access
You can set up a socket server to expose the embedding functionality for external access:

python
import socket

HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 5001

with socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) as s:
    s.bind((HOST, PORT))
    s.listen()
    print("Server is listening on port", PORT)
