Web Scraping Script Documentation

Introduction:

This Python script is designed to scrape text content from a specified webpage using the Playwright library and extract words from that text. It then saves the extracted words into a text file for further analysis or processing.

Dependencies:

Playwright: A Python library for automating interactions with web browsers.
Regular Expressions (re): Python's built-in library for working with regular expressions.
Installation:

Install Playwright using pip:
Copy code
pip install playwright
Ensure that a compatible browser (such as Chromium) is installed. Playwright will automatically download the browser binaries.
Usage:

Define the URL of the webpage you want to scrape in the url variable.
Specify the desired output filename in the output_filename variable.
Run the script. It will launch a browser, navigate to the specified URL, extract text content from the webpage, extract words using regular expressions, and save the words to the specified text file.
The extracted words will be saved in the same directory as the script.
Example:

python
Copy code
# URL of the webpage you want to scrape
url = 'https://example.com'

# Name of the text file where the words will be saved
output_filename = 'extracted_words.txt'

# Calling the function to scrape and save the words
scrape_and_save_words(url, output_filename)
